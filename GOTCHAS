## Dependency on persistent setup service
You don't need to explicitly depend on mounting/encrypting persistent storage because for every service a default dependency contains sysinit.target which in turn depends on local-fs.target which we pull in as Before= in persistent-setup.service. https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html#Default%20Dependencies
